## 15 - Lattice paths
https://projecteuler.net/problem=15
Easily solvable by noticing that the number of paths of a square is the sum of number of paths above and to the left.

In fact, this gives us Pascal's triangle, where each line of Pascal's triangle is here a diagonal of the square, which means we can immediately compute with a closed formula if we so wished.

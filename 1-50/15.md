## 15 - Lattice paths

_Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner. How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?_

Note that we only need to compute the number of paths, which means we might not even need to think about paths at all.

- The key observation is that the number of paths to reach $(i, j)$ is given by the sum of the number of paths to reach $(i-1, j)$ and $(i, j-1)$. This is because we can only move right and down, which means that we must necessarily be on those squares when we are one step away from reaching $(i, j)$.
- I programmed this solution as a 2D array of size $20 \times 20$, but in fact, what we have is simply Pascal's triangle if we look at the diagonals. Since the elements of Pascal's triangle are given by the combinational symbols ${n \choose k}$, we can compute the solution directly.

## 4 - Largest palindrome product
_9009 = 91 Ã— 99
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers._

- For checking whether a given number $n$ is a palindrome or not, I did the most straightforward idea of converting it into an array of digits, and then checking whether that array is symmetric.

- As for how I searched the space of pairs, I decided to start in the top right corner (where $x = y = 999$) and iterate in a diagonal order. Iterating this way means that we roughly follow the order of decreasing product of $x * y$.
- Once I have found a palindrome, I am still not sure that I have indeed found the maximum. The function we are trying to maximize is $(x, y) \mapsto x*y$

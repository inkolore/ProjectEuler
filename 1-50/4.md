## 4 - Largest palindrome product
_9009 = 91 Ã— 99
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers._

- For checking whether a given number $n$ is a palindrome or not, I did the most straightforward idea of converting it into an array of digits, and then checking whether that array is symmetric.

- As for how I searched the space of pairs, I decided to start in the top right corner (where $x = y = 999$) and iterate in a diagonal order. Iterating this way means that we roughly follow the order of decreasing product of $x * y$.
- Once I have found a palindrome, I am still not sure that I have indeed found the maximum. For a given value $c$, the set of all points in 2D space that have a product larger than $c$ can be seen by drawing the curve $x * y = c$, i.e the curve $y = c / x$. In order to make sure that I have found the maximum, I thus only have to check in the top right area demarked by this contour curve.
- An optimization for this last part would be to only check the points above the contour curve that I haven't iterated through with my diagonal iteration. I didn't bother, and I don't think it would be too difficult, but it is worth noting.

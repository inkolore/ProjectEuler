## 4 - Largest palindrome product
https://projecteuler.net/problem=4
9009 = 91 Ã— 99
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Naive solution :
- Transform number into array of numbers, so I can check if it's palindrome
- Search the 2D space of numbers in a decreasing and **diagonal** fashion

- [x] More subtle than that, because I'm not sure that if I find a palindrome this way, that it's necessarily the maximum
The points that share the same value of product follow $y = c/x$, (contour lines). So an optimal thing would be to check the area within that contour line, minus all the points already computed (a sort of triangle).

Heuristic 1 :
- search all couples from top right corner, and go left until the product is < product_found and palindromic. This is not super optimal because we are potentially going over already computed points.
I have something that works. It's not super optimal for the last check, but I think it's reasonable.
- Small improvement : take (diag-1) so that I don't have to recompute over the last triangle I have explored

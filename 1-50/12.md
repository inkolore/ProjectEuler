## 12 - Highly divisible triangular number
_Find the value of the first triangular number with five hundred divisors_

A triangle number $T_n$ has the follow formula, again from problem 1 for example :
$$T_n = \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$

- One crucial idea is that for any non zero natural $n$, then $n$ is co-prime with $n+1$. This is simply because the small prime number is $2 > 1$, and that assuming that $n$ and $n+1$ share a common prime factor leads to an absurdity.
- If we note $d(.)$ the function that computes the number of divisors of a number, then we have that $d(n_1 n_2) = d(n_1) d(n_2)$ if $n_1$ and $n_2$ are co-prime. This is very useful because, when combined with the previous fact and the formula for a triangular number, we only need to compute the number of divisors of something in the order of $n$. We simply have to split the cases of $n$ even and $n$ odd to see for which factor we apply the division by $2$.

I personally didn't implement a smart lower or upper bound, but there is a pretty obvious lower bound we can use. Because $d(n) \leq n$, since a number can't have more divisors than its value, then we have
$$500 \geq d(T_n) \leq n(n+1)/2$$

## 12 - Highly divisible triangular number
https://projecteuler.net/problem=12
Find value of first triangular number with five hundred divisors
$$
T_n = \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2},
$$
Idea I have :
- Because of the form of a triangular number, and the fact that $n$ and $n + 1$ are always coprime, if we note $d(.)$ as the number of divisors, then $d(T_n) = d(n/2) \times d(n+1)$ (assuming $n$ is even, and putting the divisor on $n+1$ otherwise)
- Not sure it's amazing, because we would have to go pretty high, like $n = 2000$ or even $n = 10000$ for example to get it. Rough estimate : $\sqrt{500} \approx 22.36 < 23$, so we would need two numbers with $23$ factors at least. 360 is the smallest number with 24 factors for example.
	- So an array of size $1000$ (how to estimate in general ?) and needing to compute number of divisors for all those numbers

- Computing number of divisors : can just iterate by 1 from 1 to $\sqrt{n}$ as the most naive algorithm, and multiplying result by $2$ (and add 1 if number perfect square).

Solution : 76576500 is the 12375th triangular number. Worked after I fixed some problem related to indices.

Upper bound for max search : (500 / 2)^2, where 500 is the lower bound of divisors searched.
- [ ] Not sure why that's true

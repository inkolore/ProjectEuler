## 17 - Number letter counts
https://projecteuler.net/problem=17
Super interesting.
Naive idea : implement a converter of number to British convention number :
- 342 = Three hundred and forty-two - contains 23 letters (no spaces or hyphens counted)
- 115 = One hundred and fifteen -  contains 20 letters.

Note that we only need to know **number of letters**, not have an explicit converter (but this might be useful or needed idk).
- Way to optimize : 1115 is an append on 115, so can reuse the result.

We need to have all numbers from 1 to 1000 (inclusive), so we could build a table of size 1000 in an iterative fashion.

**Idea** : I don't need to assign each number its length, I can count how many times "fourty" appears from 1 to 1000 for example, if that helps.

Answer : 21124 (seems concensus)
My answer : 21213

- [x] No idea what's going wrong

I looked at spelling, and I used "fourty" when it's "forty" here wtf. Now it's correct

_Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers._

The obvious problem is that each 50-digit number is too large for a typical integer value : a 64 unsigned type has a max value of $2^{64} - 1 \approx 1.844e+19 < 10^{50} - 1$.

The most immediate way to circumvent this is to use an array of digits to represent each number, and using long addition to compute the sum. Starting from the digits associated with the lowest power, then we can simply add each digit, keep the remainder modulo 10 and carry out the rest, divided by 10, for the next digit.

The final number can have at most $52$ digits, since we have 100 numbers of $50$ digits, the max value would be $100 * (10^{50} - 1) < 10^{52} - 1$.

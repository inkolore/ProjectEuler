_Work out the first ten digits of the sum of the following one-hundred 50-digit numbers._

The obvious problem is that each 50-digit number is too large for a typical integer value : a 64 unsigned type has a max value of $2^{64} - 1 \approx 1.844e+19 < 10^{50} - 1$.

The most immediate way to circumvent this is to use an array of digits to represent each number, and using long addition to compute the sum.

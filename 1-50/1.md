## 1 - Multiples of 3 or 5
"If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000."

Maths solution : We compute 'sum of all multiples of 3 + sum of all multiples of 5 - sum of multiples of 15', where the last sum is to remove terms we have double counted. The arithmetic sum $S = 1 + 2 + \cdots + n$ has a neat formula, where we can observe that if we compute
$$1 + 2 + \cdots + n$$
$$+ n + (n-1) + \cdots + 1,$$
then we have computed $2S$, and that this is also equal to $n$ times $n + 1$. The answer is then given by :
$$\begin{aligned}
&\sum_{j = 1}^{\lfloor 999/3 \rfloor} 3j
+ \sum_{j = 1}^{\lfloor 999/5 \rfloor} 5j
- \sum_{j = 1}^{\lfloor 999/15 \rfloor} 15j \\
=& 3 \dfrac{333(334)}{2} + 5 \dfrac{199(200)}{2} - 15 \dfrac{66(67)}{2} \\
=& 233168.
\end{aligned}$$

## 5 - Smallest multiple
https://projecteuler.net/problem=5
"What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?"

Another solution :
- List all prime numbers below $n$
- Find highest power of each prime < $n$
- Multiply all of those highest powers (careful of overflow again)

### Thinking about LCM (least common multiple)
- [x] Is lcm associative ?
Yes, by using decomposition by primes it is very clear, since max is associative.
- Could do that, sounds better than creating prime decomposition of all numbers. Compute $lcm$ by using the formula $lcm(a, b) = ab / gcd(a,b)$, where the latter is simply going to be implemented with an incrementation
- Potential problem : result is bigger than `int` limit
- Also, order of how we do ppcm makes computation faster, but I don't know an algorithm that could find a faster order

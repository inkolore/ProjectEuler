## 5 - Smallest multiple
_What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?_

- The least common multiple of $k$ numbers can be seen clearly when we consider the prime decomposition of those numbers. Indeed, it is given by the product of all primes found within the $k$ numbers, raised to the max power encountered.
- Because we are multiplying all numbers between 1 and 20, our problem can be solved by multiplying all the biggest prime powers that are below 20. By prime power, I mean a number of the form $p^n$ where $p$ is a prime number. Indeed, the largest power of $5$ below $30$ for example is $25$, because if we multiplied $5$ by any other prime, we are making this number bigger without increasing its contribution to the power of $5$.
- From this observation, the problem is easy because finding all the prime numbers below $20$ is instantaneous and doesn't even require a decent algorithm (I simply used an iterative approach like in problem 3).

# 24 - Lexicographic permutations

_The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
012   021   102   120   201   210
What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?_

- My first observation was that the first digit of the permutation only increased when we had gone through all the permutation of the other digits.

# 24 - Lexicographic permutations

_The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
012   021   102   120   201   210
What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?_

- My first observation was that the first digit of the permutation only increased when we had gone through all the permutation of the other digits. This means that if we have $n$ symbols, then the first $(n-1)!$ lexicographic permutations will have the same initial symbol.
- We can thus compute the first digit of the millionth permutation using integer division by $(n-1)!$. The remainder will also us to compute the next digits.
- We can proceed in the same fashion for the other digits, starting from the remainder of the previous step.
- One thing to keep in mind is that we must keep a list of the remaining digits, and make sure it is in increasing order, so as to make sure that we assign the right digit as we move through the decomposition of the number 1000 000.

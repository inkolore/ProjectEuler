## 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers
"By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."

- Observation : each even term is the sum of two previous terms which were odd. This means that we have one even term every 3 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
- A naive bruteforce wouldn't be too bad I think. 4 million isn't a very big number to begin with, and Fibonacci sequence grows fast (exponential w.r.t. golden ratio)
	- We just have to keep in memory 2 last fibonacci numbers and the sum (assuming int is large enough, otherwise use long)
- The sum of all even Fibonacci numbers, if we end at an even one, is equal to one half of the sum of all Fibonacci numbers. Not sure how useful this is though.

I went for a simple coding solution based on those, no better mathematical idea.

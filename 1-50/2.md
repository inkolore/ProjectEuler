## 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers
"By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."

I didn't have any clever idea to solve this, so I simply computed the Fibonacci terms one by one.
- I used a 64bit integer for the sum because overflow could always be an issue
- We only need to keep in memory the 2 current terms, as say $f_1$ and $f_2$

## 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers
_By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms._

I didn't have any clever idea to solve this, so I simply computed the Fibonacci terms one by one.
- We only need to keep in memory the 2 current terms, as say $f_1$ and $f_2$.
Then by doing the following operations :
$$f_2 := f_1 + f_2$$
$$f_1 := f_2 - f_1$$
We can update the terms while only keeping 2 in memory.

- I used a 64bit integer for the sum because overflow could always be an issue

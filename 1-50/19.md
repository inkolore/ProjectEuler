https://projecteuler.net/problem=19
How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)? Look at info on dates

- 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
- Leap days are a bit complicated though

I have something that works. It's not terribly efficient in terms of checks but it does the job.

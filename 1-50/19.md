_How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?, knowing that 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday, and knowing the rules for when we have a leap year ?_

I didn't do anything too sophisticated, and simply incremented starting from Sunday 7 January 1900. Some things to consider :
- Only starting to count when we are in 1901
- The number of days in a month depends on the month and whether it is a leap year obviously
Otherwise it's simple usage of the modulo operator to get the remainder of day when we get to the next month.

## 3 - Largest prime factor
_The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?_

My initial idea was to use a sieve to find all the prime numbers below $\sqrt{n}$, but this quickly proved to be very wasteful.
Indeed, there is no need to find all the prime numbers, we only care about those that divide the given number.

So I turned to an algorithm that is learned in high school, which consists in iterating over the prime numbers in an increasing fashion, and whenever possible, divide $n$ by a prime factor until it's no longer possible.
For getting the list of prime numbers, I simply keep in memory all the ones I have already found, and keep adding 2 to the large prime found so far until it is co-prime with the list (very naive iterative method).

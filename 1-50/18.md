## 18 - Maximum path sum
https://projecteuler.net/problem=18
This looks like textbook discrete optimization but I have no theory in that field.
Very interesting problem, also I don't know the formula for counting number of paths there.

Idea :
- Starting from bottom, we can remove useless nodes, because each node above has a simple choice of which one to pick. For example, the 63 node on layer l-1 will choose 62, the 66node on l-1 will choose 98, etc.
- So the nodes on layer l-1 have a definite value. We can then repeat the same procedure for layer l-2, etc.
- Repeat until we are done.

- [ ] I don't know how I would save the best solution as a path, since here I am just saving the sum at the end.
When I am computing the max, I could save a "left" or "right" in another array
And then append those as I go up, to keep the one I need. And then reverse the final result.
Don't really care enough to do that though.

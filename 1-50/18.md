## 18 - Maximum path sum
_By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23. Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:_

I had heard of the term "discrete optimization" before and I thought this was going to be it, but turns out the answer was simpler than I expected. While thinking about the path from top to bottom, nothing really appeared to me as an improvement over a brute force. However, when I was thinking about it from bottom up, the solution appeared to me :

- Starting from the bottom layer $l$, we can remove useless nodes, because each node above has a simple choice of which one to pick.
- For example, the 63 node on layer $l-1$ will choose 62, the 66 node on $l-1$ will choose 98, etc.
- So each node on layer $l-1$ has its associated best choice, which means that by adding this best choice to the value of the node, we have found the best paths of length $2$, starting from the layer $l-1$
-  We can then repeat the same procedure for layer $l-2$, where we use the new values we computed (best path values) instead of the node values
-  Repeat until we get to the top

I didn't bother implementing a way to save what path is the maximum one, and only kept in memory the sum. I don't think it would be too bad though, as we just need to record whether we chose the left or the right neighbor when looking at the 2 nodes under, and then appending those choices to form the path we chose.

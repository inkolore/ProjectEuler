## 28 - Number spiral diagonals
My idea starts from the observation that following the top right diagonal, we seem to have squares of odd numbers : 1, 9, 25, 49.
I verified this fact, and noticed that in order to go from one corner to the order, we subtract the same number for each **layer**.

I can thus obtain a pretty nice formula for the result, which means I don't have to actually create the table of numbers.

### Results
Note the 1st layer $n = 1$, which corresponds to the outermost layer of a $3 \times 3$ square. So $l$ = length of squares is given by $l = 2n + 1$.
The sum of the diagonals up to $n$ is given by
$$
S(n) = 1 + \sum_{j = 1}^n \biggl[ (2j + 1)^2 + ((2j+1)^2 - 2j) + ((2j+1)^2 - 4j) + ((2j+1)^2 - 6j) \biggr],
$$
where the $j$-th term corresponds to the $j$ layer, and the 4 terms give the 4 corners.
We can simplify $S$, using [[Sum of first n powers]]
$$
\begin{align*}
S
&= 1 + \sum_{j = 1}^n \biggl[ 4(2j + 1)^2 - 12j \biggr] \\
&= 1 + \sum_{j = 1}^n \biggl[ 4(4j^2 + 4j + 1) - 12j \biggr] \\
&= 1 + \sum_{j = 1}^n \bigl( 16j^2 + 4j + 4 \bigr) \\
&= 1 + 4n + 4 \dfrac{n(n+1)}{2} + 16 \dfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \\
&= 1 + 4n + 2n(n+1) + \dfrac{8}{3}n(n+1)(2n+1) \\
&= \dfrac{16}{3} n^3 + 10n^2 + \dfrac{26}{3}n + 1
\end{align*}
$$

Checking :
- $n = 1$ we have 25
- $n = 2$ we have 101

What we want : $n = 500$ for $l = 1001$, so
$$
S(500) = 669 \hspace{1mm} 171 \hspace{1mm} 001
$$

## 7 - 10001st prime
https://projecteuler.net/problem=7
"What is the 10 001st prime number?"

Naive idea : iterate through odd numbers and check if it can't be divided by all primes already found.
- Potential problem : int max value
`I implemented naive solution with ints`

The problem with the sieve is that it's good for finding all numbers up to $n$, but I don't see how you can require it to find a certain prime. Plus it's heavy on memory initially to have all numbers.

## 7 - 10001st prime
_What is the 10 001st prime number?_

Again, while the idea of the sieve is great for finding all the prime numbers below a given number $n$, it is not so great when $n$ isn't known it seems. So I simply went for the most naive idea of keeping a list of prime numbers already found, and iterating over the odd numbers to find the next one.

Computers are powerful enough that this was immediate, but there are probably many refinements possible to this method.

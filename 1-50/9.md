## 9 - Special pythagorean triplet
_There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. (natural numbers only). Find the product abc._

- My immediate idea was to combine the equations $a + b + c = 1000$ and $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ to see how nice the resulting constraint would be. We get the following :
$$a^2 + b^2 = (1000 - (a+b))^2$$
$$a^2 + b^2 = 1000^2 - 2000(a+b) + (a+b)^2$$
$$a^2 + b^2 = 1000^2 - 2000(a+b) + a^2 + 2ab + b^2$$
$$0 = 1000^2 - 2000(a+b) + 2ab$$
$$2000a - 1000^2 = b(2a - 2000)$$
$$b = \dfrac{2000a - 1000^2}{2a - 2000} = \dfrac{1000(a - 500)}{a - 1000}$$

As a result, we only have one unknown value given by $a$, and we need to make sure that $b$ is an integer (which I checked by computing the numerator modulo denominator and seeing if it's zero or not).

My implementation doesn't take into account $a < b < c$, but in the case of computing the product, it doesn't matter anyway.

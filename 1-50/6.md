## 6 - Sum square difference
_Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum._

- This problem is immediate when we know the formula for the sum of the squares. That formula is easy to verify by induction, but establishing from scratch is a bit harder. If I had to find that formula by myself, I would personally start from the hypothesis that the sum is a polynomial of degree 3, and then apply polynomial interpolation to find the coefficients. And then, after finding the coefficients, I would check by induction that the formula indeed applies.

The formules are given by
1) $n(n+1)(2n+1)/6$ for the sum of the squares
2) $n^2(n+1)^2 /4$ for the square of the sum

Result :
$$\dfrac{1}{4}n^4 + \dfrac{1}{2}n^3 + \dfrac{1}{4}n^2 - \dfrac{1}{3}n^3 - \dfrac{1}{2}n^2 - \dfrac{1}{6}n$$
$$= \dfrac{1}{4}n^4 + \dfrac{1}{6}n^3 - \dfrac{1}{4}n^2 - \dfrac{1}{6}n$$

For $n = 100$, result = $25 164 150$
